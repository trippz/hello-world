# hello-world
This is my first repository

Hello Firnds!

This is my first time using Git and GitHub. Ive seen and heard about this many times before but never really knew what it did or how to use it.
Today that changes!
I am taking the time and steps to learn how to use this seemingly profound tool and hopefully it changes my life.
